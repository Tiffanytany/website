      <description>The following data there are 303 items (patients) and 13 predictor variables (age, sex, cholesterol, etc.) The variable to predict is encoded as 0 to 4 where 0 means no heart disease and 1-4 means presence of heart disease. The following varaibles are the ones that I will be focusing on: Sex = (1 = male; 0 = female), thalach = maximum heart rate achieved, cp = chest pain type (0 to 4 where 0 means no heart disease and 1-4 means presence of heart disease), trestbps = resting blood pressure (in mm Hg on admission to the hospital), and chol = serum cholestoral in mg/dl.</description>
